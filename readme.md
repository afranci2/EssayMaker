## Tech Stack

**Client:** HTML/CSS, Javascript

**Server:** Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, OpenAI API


## Algorithms/API
An outline is first requested based on the assignment. A linear search algorithm converts the Roman numerals of the outline into sections by numbers. Another algorithm developed requests text completion in chunks based on the previous algorithm. The algorithm uses a loop of fetch requests to generate essay sections based on the number of sections determined by the previous algorithm.
